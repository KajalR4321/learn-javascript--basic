# Learn JavaScript

This repository is part of my JavaScript learning journey.  
It begins with the basics â€” variables, constants, and data types â€” and will gradually expand to include more advanced topics, such as functions, loops, arrays, and DOM manipulation.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- Basic Examples and Practice
